to do:
error message when a user tries to add a serial number that already exists
that said, serial numbers need to be allowed to be entered more than once
in the case of a new project number with field kits only, shouldn't the user add a machine to the project so that the serial number is referenced?
when you add a kit, there should be a dialog box to choose a specific serial number, or alternatively apply the kit to all applicable serial numbers for that project
when you add a machine (serial number) to a job, a boolean should indicate if it is an original machine or referenced machine for a field kit
in fact, if the serial number already exists then the boolean can default to a referenced machine
